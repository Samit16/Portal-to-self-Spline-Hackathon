# 🌀 Portal to Self – Spline Hackathon Project

Welcome to **Portal to Self**, a 3D interactive web experience built with love for the **Spline x Contra Hackathon**. This project blends visual storytelling with smooth user interaction to create a digital mirror — a space to explore and reflect.

> “Step into the portal. Look within.”

## 🌟 What It Does

**Portal to Self** is a digital portal powered by 3D animations, parallax movement, and UI elements that respond to cursor behavior and user movement. It’s a conceptual piece designed to:
- Reflect emotion through motion
- Guide users through a serene, interactive interface
- Showcase creative use of AI-assisted development tools (Bolt + Spline)

- ✨ **[Spline](https://spline.design/)** – for 3D scenes and animation  
- ⚛️ **React + TypeScript** – frontend logic and components  
- ⚡ **Vite** – for ultra-fast bundling and development  
- 🎨 **Tailwind CSS** – for styling
